To subscribe to this blog, you have several options.

## The RSS Feed

The RSS feed is located at:

[https://craigtaub.dev/rss.xml](https://craigtaub.dev/rss.xml)

Historically most browsers had built-in support for feeds, but unfortunately most do not anymore. However RSS feeds are still extremely well supported by content producers. If you're reading blogs or news sites today the chance is incredibly high that an RSS is offered.

I recommend <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/" target="\_blank">Thunderbird</a> as both an email and news reader. Let me know if you have any other suggestsion and I can list them here.

## Email list

I set up a <a href="https://mailchi.mp/ea6a77bd5a3e/javascript-under-the-hood-of" target="\_blank">mailing list</a> if you prefer email.

## Other ways

I post blog updates on <a href="https://twitter.com/craigtaub" target="\_blank">Twitter</a>.

I post JavaScript videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYi23MnKBKn0yLZKBrz5Bfw" target="\_blank">YouTube</a>.
