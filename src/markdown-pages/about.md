Hi i'm Craig

![My YouTube channel](/images/me.png)

I am a software engineer living in London who as been in the industry for over 10 years.
I describe myself as a problem-solver who is very interested in delivery and impact. From a technical-side I post mainly about **JavaScript** and **NodeJS** but also occasionally about performance, testing, databases, dev-ops and best-practices.
Also I have been on the MochaJS core team for over 2 years, testing and open-source is something I care deeply about.
Lastly I am a big football fan and support QPR.

Please feel free to email me anytime at **craigtaub@gmail.com**

I hope you enjoy my blog.
